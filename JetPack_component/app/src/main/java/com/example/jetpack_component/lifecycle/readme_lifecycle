In the life cycle

1. we need to ad dependency in app gradle file

 implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-extensions:2.0.0'

2. make a class which is extends by LifecycleObserver and create a method with @OnLifecycleEvent

     @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE)
         fun onCreateCall() {
         Log.e("TAG: activity on create event","Hiiii i am on pause")
        }

3. Add this observable class add in activity

    lifecycle.addObserver(MainActivityLifeCycle())
